declare classes for specific class of items. 
put properties of a class in private and functions of a class in public. 
use constructors for accessing private data. 
structs in c++ are basically public classes. 
//templates 
excellently explained in usaco guide
template<class T>
struct Point3D {
    T x, y, z;
};
 
Point3D<int> p1{1, 2, 3}; 
Point3D<double> p1{1.1, 2.2, 3.3}; 
using lambda expressions
small functions!!
auto lambda = [](auto){ do something}; 
auto a = lambda(b);
